<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Plan</h3>
<p>This project aims to produce a prototype micro-farming management system. This system will include management panels for landowners tenants, suppliers and buyers.</p>

<p>The finished product will take advantage of cloud-based hosting and databases. It will also have an API to allow the client to be flexible with their front-end and keep the possibility of extending the product to other platforms in the future. For this project, we aim to deliver the requirements in the form of:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A web application with sleek, user-friendly design.</li>
    <li>Cloud-Based hosting platform and database</li>
    <li>Sample documentation for landowners and tenants.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Basic Requirements</h3>
<p>These are the basic requirements of the project, as specified in the brief. They have been split into interfaces relevant to the needs of each group that may be using the application.</p>

<h4>Land-Owners interface</h4>
<p>This interface will allow a landowner to add and remove plots and allocate land to tenants. Both tenants and landowners will be able to view documentation, contracts and bills associated with the plot.</p>

<h4>Tenants interface</h4>
<p>The tenant’s area will include features to express their interest in a plot, view a map of available plots and sign up for waiting lists. Once involved in a contract with a landowner, a tenant will also be able to view related documentation, contracts and bills related to their plot. A tenant will also be able to issue notice periods to a landowner when they are not interested in maintaining a plot.</p>

<h4>Suppliers interface</h4>
<p>The resource will include a directory of suppliers alongside available deals to be offered to landowners and tenants.</p>

<h4>Buyers interface</h4>
This area will allow a buyer to register their interest in specific produce, allowing tenants to sell their produce to local buyers.

<br /><br />
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>These goals sit outside the base requirements but will add extra functionality to the product. They will be completed if the basic requirements have been finished to a high standard.</p>

<h4>Maintenance interface</h4>
<p>Here, a tenant will be able to notify the landowner of maintenance issues with their plot. The landowner will be able to add actions to allow the tenant to track the status of the issue through to completion.</p>

<h4>Supplier interface</h4>
<p>In this interface, a supplier will be able to update and add new deals to advertise to tenants and landowners. Suppliers can use the page to negotiate directly with tenants and landowners.</p>

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Meet the Team</h3>
<p>Our team has experience across all aspects of the project, covering all the bases of the project requirements.</p>

<h4>Ryan S</h4>
<p>Out of all the projects listed, this one really stood out to me. This combined with the team’s motivation to win this bid and deliver a great product only further cemented my interest. The project has a lot of interesting elements to it and offers great potential in terms of both technical and personal development. Based on bullet points listed within the project description, there could potentially be some complicated logic that would need to be thoroughly thought through, presenting an interesting challenge for the team.</p>

<p>From very early discussions with the team in terms of the technical direction of this project, the types of technologies we are leaning towards are NodeJS, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MongoDB. All of which I have had previous experience in, either professionally or from personal projects. In terms of the softer skills required to successfully deliver a project, I have previous experience in project delivery and exhibit strong team working and communication skills.</p>

<h4>Harriet J</h4>
<p>I'm interested in this project above the others because of the separate elements of it that all group together to form one result. I personally think this is a perfect group project for a team like ours. With such different skills for people to work on their strongest strength, either front end design, database work or back end software development, it means each person can work amazingly with their choice, but everyone can also learn and help out with the different skills. I believe we can work to make this project truly unique with a user-friendly front end and an efficient, well written back end.</p>

<p>Personally, I think this is a good project for me as I can work with designing and front-end work, which I thoroughly enjoy but also dip in and out and improve my skills with back-end software development.</p>

<p>In the past I’ve gained experience and knowledge on multiple languages and other technologies which will be very useful in this project. I have also attended a course on agile learning which will assist massively, as well as teamwork, communication and other soft skills I have picked up throughout work and other projects.</p>

<h4>Ethan M</h4>
<p>I find this particular project the most interesting as the concept itself will provide lots of challenges in web development, front-end design and collaborating as a team. It will also offer opportunities for our team to be creative in the way in which we go about solving the problems it presents – this is what I am looking forward to the most. Other than the interesting concept, I am intent on doing this project because there are parts which are very relevant to my skillset. I have useful experience with web development frameworks and have developed in a web application in an agile team before. As my skills and experience go hand in hand with this project, I believe there will be plenty of opportunities for me to benefit the project.</p>

<h4>Tom E</h4>
<p>
    I really enjoy and thrive in front end development and immediately when reading the brief for this project, ideas were already popping in my head. With 4 different possible interfaces, I like the idea of merging them into 1 professional looking, streamline management system to fit the brief of the micro-farming client. I have had the pleasure of previously working in 4 different agile software development teams. With that in mind, I believe that I can bring my eye for effective design, communication skills and adaptability to the team which is made up of a fantastic range of like-minded individuals. Above all, this project gets me excited. I am a strong believer that if you are interested and passionate about a project, the result is one of excellence with high levels of attention to detail. I have appropriate knowledge in multiple languages and frameworks and have a small amount of experience using AWS so I am looking to develop these skills alongside my team throughout the
    completion of this project.

<h4>Niall A</h4>
<p>I feel that his would be an interesting project to work on with others as it involves multiple different elements working together, such as frontend design, database design and implementation, data handling, manipulation and management, cloud computing and the potential for a ticketing system. I don’t have much hands on experience using AWS systems, however I have completed AWS training courses and have done web-development, system design, algorithm design & analysis, and API management in prior work, which I think will help towards the backend system design, creation and management of this project. I think that my time spent in an agile based team can contribute towards time keeping, effective communications and adaptability to requirement changes.</p>

<p>Through past work, I have knowledge and technical aptitude in multiple languages and frameworks, such as Java, NodeJS, Python and NoSQL. I have worked on algorithm design and analysis, agile approaches to software design and creation, API documentation and alteration, and virtualisation with OpenShift / Docker.</p>

<h4>Jenny S</h4>
<p>I would love to take part in this project. It jumped out at me from the beginning as an interesting concept and an opportunity to be creative with both the design and the structure of the database and hosting. My strengths lie in front-end design, presentation and documentation. Additionally, I have experience with databases, cloud computing (I have participated in AWS courses) and hosting and so will be able to contribute across the project. I think that the team covers all roles needed for this project and that we would be an ideal choice to go forward.</p>
